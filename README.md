PSP Hardware Alarm Interface SRC Package
---------------------------------------

As I promised, here's the full as-is source.

This is still an ON-GOING project and still supported by me (Mr305). 

I donot ENDORSE nor SUPPORT any 'enhancements' or 'mods'; however you can freely make any changes AS LONG AS it's private and NOT shared to the public. Hope everyone understands this.

I Hope this will be of much use new developers who are looking to move onto PSP for development. Remember, It's the GREATEST PORTABLE ever created [to this date :P]




Enjoy,

-Mr305-
